## Abstract

Reading poetry closely requires the reader to slow down and attend to the formal features of the text at hand. Similarly, encoding a document, in a markup language like XML, requires the encoder to understand, carefully, the structural and semantic makeup of the document. Through this shared attention to form, structure, and semantics, we can use Textual Encoding Initiative XML as a pedagogical aid for teachers and students of poetry.

This project will deliver a prototype of a Web-based application that allows users to search for or upload poetry, encode that poetry, and compare their encodings to those of others. 

This technology might help teachers of either poetry and poetics or the digital humanities. Indeed, it could supplement in-class discussions on the practice of close reading or the mechanics of encoding; it could also help teachers solicit and review encoding assignments. Though textual scholars might also be interested in such a prototype—e.g. for building small-scale digital editions with various transcriptions or markup—this project will focus more on pedagogy than on scholarship. Given that encoding remains a fundamental aspect of computing, and close reading a fundamental tactic for interpreting poetry, such technology should remain relevant for the foreseeable future.

### Statement of Innovation

### Statement of Humanities Significance

## Narrative

If text encoding constitutes a fundamental, but basic, task in computing, then close reading constitutes a similarly fundamental, but basic, task in literary criticism. For many developers, wrangling HTML or XML tags remains a mundane part of their work—important, certainly, but not as energizing as writing, for example, applications in Python, Ruby, or a host of other programming languages. Meanwhile, close reading encourages literary critics to demonstrate how the formal elements of a literary text articulate meaning. Since the emergence of close reading, in the post-war period dominated by the New Criticism, however, literary critics have increasingly emphasized the importance of contextual, rather than formal, readings of texts. While close reading operates as an indispensable tool, it serves as the basis for contextual interpretations of literary texts in contemporary scholarship.

How might humanists, then, approach encoding and close reading? Should they continue to assign both basic roles in their respective spheres? Or should the (digital) humanities establish new connections between encoding and close reading and, in doing so, re-envision their roles in contemporary literary studies? The second approach seems worthwhile and, as Kate Singer has argued in the *Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy*, “the practice of encoding effectively engages the encoder in a determinative act of reading” (Singer). Encoding, in other words, generates a (close) reading of the text at hand. Susan Schreibman makes a similar argument: “Text encoding ... is not theory-free. It is subjective, theoretical, and interpretative. Texts, particularly literary texts, have competing hierarchies, all of which may have equal claim to being represented as they express different views of the text” (Schreibman). “Subjective,” “theoretical,” “interpretive,” and “competing hierarchies” that “express different views of the text”—the vocabulary here could describe close reading. If encoding prompts “determinative” reading, and if encoding itself is never “theory-free,” then we can regard it increasingly as a humanistic act. Devising a platform, and building a prototype of it, can encourage others to see these connections and incorporate them into their pedagogy (or even scholarship).

Of course, individuals could encode any literary text or document with such a prototype. Poetry, however, offers a good point of departure for considering the relationship between encoding and close reading. Studying poetry forces readers to contend with formal techniques related to hierarchies (e.g. section, stanza, line) and semantic values (e.g. alliteration, enjambment, simile) that encoding might capture well. As Chuck Rybak writes in *Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities*, “Poetry is a formal enterprise, and those forms have been evolving for centuries. We have new forms before us. We need new pedagogies to match” (Rybak). This project aims to aid new pedagogies for the study of “the formal enterprise” of poetry. In encoding, it finds a digital practice akin to the close reading that has, for some time, been the means for understanding the forms, and the evolution of those forms, that comprise poetry.

## Appendix: Use Cases

### English or Comparative Literature Professor

Professor Peter Poetics teaches a 200-level class on the study of poetry at a small liberal arts college. He’s interested in multimodal pedagogy but hasn’t come across a decent technique or technology to teach basic poetics digitally. Though he thinks that TEI encoding might help his students understand the hierarchies and techniques at work in many of the works on the syllabus, he feels that existing technologies would be too confusing for non-specialist undergraduates. What he needs is a platform that simplifies encoding through discrete tasks.  

### Digital Humanities Professor

Professor Debbie DH teaches “Digital Humanities 101” at a large state university. Her class provides a multidisciplinary survey of the field, and she tries to incorporate as many praxis-oriented activities as possible into the syllabus. During her week on digital editions and the emergence of the digital humanities in English departments, she wants her students to attempt their own encodings of some documents. Her students have solid computing skills or are acquiring them—they would have no issues using software like Oxygen to complete their encoding assignments. Debbie DH wants an easy way to display these encodings in class, however, in order to chart the subtle changes across submissions. She needs a platform that can archive multiple encodings and display the differences among them through a compelling design.
