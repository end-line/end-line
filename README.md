# end/line

We began with a simple question: how does encoding affect our experiences with poetry? End/line answers this question. Free and open source, it is a platform that allows users to upload and encode poems. They can then share their encodings with others, who, in turn, can add and compare their own encodings. Built using TEI guidelines, end/line remains committed to current humanistic standards for creating digital texts.
