# Project Workplan: end/line

## Introduction

The project once known, awkwardly, as “encoding as close reading” has now become “end/line.” It will deliver a prototype of a platform, aimed at teachers of undergraduate poetry/poetics and digital humanities classes, for submitting and comparing TEI-tagged poetry. This prototype will live at endlineproject.org.

For more information on the project in general, see the [revised proposal](https://github.com/tlewek/dh-praxis-16-17/blob/master/proposal/dh-praxis-proposal.md).

## General Communication

All general communication will go through [Slack](https://encodedpoetry.slack.com). Our Slack account also has back-end, front-end, community management (i.e. scholarly outreach), and TEI channels for more detailed communications related to those areas. 

Each Thursday, the project manager will send a digest email, detailing the work accomplished in the past week, the work expected over the next week, and any specific items that the team needs from individual members. Over the course of each week, the project manager will also use [Trello](https://trello.com) to help manage such work.

All code will be committed to this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tlewek/encoded-poetry). And we have started a [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9stuL706rnfX1hFcV9CbkZTNmM) to share any miscellaneous assets, ideas, or communication not covered in the plan above.

**Important:** Please let the group know if you’re going to miss a deadline via the general Slack channel. We can find alternative ways to accomplish the work, but we can’t afford to fall behind schedule.

## Roles

Tom will serve as the project director and project manager. He will also assist with community management and development tasks as needed.

### Scholarly Outreach

Iuri will communicate with potential users (for feedback and, ideally, beta testing in late March/early April) and familiarize the group with TEI generally.

Michael will oversee the publicity efforts for end/line; he will manage the project blog and the Twitter and email support accounts.

### Development

Brian will manage the back-end development of the prototype and consult on front-end tasks as needed.

Greg will manage the front-end development and assist with back-end development and project management tasks as needed.

## Tasks

See below for individual tasks split into scholarly outreach, development, and miscellaneous categories. The task appears first, followed by the individual responsible for completing it and the deadline for doing so.

We haven’t included the recurring project management tasks—e.g., facilitating communication on Slack, writing weekly digests. Similarly, task assignees in both the scholarly outreach and development areas should feel free to ask Tom to contribute some work to their tasks if they become more complicated than previously envisioned.
